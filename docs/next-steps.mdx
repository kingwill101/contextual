description: What to do after getting started with Contextual
---

Now that you've set up basic logging with Contextual, here are some next steps to enhance your logging setup:

- **[API Reference](../api/overview.mdx)**: Dive deeper into Contextual's classes, methods, and configuration options.
- **[Advanced Features](../advanced/middleware.mdx)**: Learn about middleware for transforming logs, batching for performance, and integrating with frameworks like Shelf.
- **[Driver Guides](../api/drivers/daily-file.mdx)**: Explore specific drivers for file logging, webhooks, and more.
- **[Migration Guide](../migration/v2.mdx)**: If upgrading from v1, see how to migrate your code to the new typed APIs.
- **[Type Formatters & Printers](../advanced/type-formatters.mdx)**: Customize how domain objects and structured data appear in logs.

## Common Next Steps

### Add Structured Context

Enhance your logs with rich context for better debugging:

```dart
logger.withContext({
  'user_id': currentUser.id,
  'request_id': generateRequestId(),
  'environment': 'production',
}).info('Processing payment');
```

### Configure Multiple Outputs

Send logs to different destinations based on environment:

```dart
final config = LogConfig(
  environment: 'production',
  channels: [
    ConsoleChannel(ConsoleOptions(), name: 'console'), // For development
    DailyFileChannel(DailyFileOptions(path: 'logs/app'), name: 'file'), // For production
    WebhookChannel(WebhookOptions(url: Uri.parse('https://logs.example.com')), name: 'remote'), // For monitoring
  ],
);
```

### Add Middleware

Transform or filter logs automatically:

```dart
final logger = await Logger.create(
  config: LogConfig(
    channels: [ConsoleChannel(ConsoleOptions(), name: 'console')],
    middlewares: [
      () => {'timestamp': DateTime.now().toIso8601String()},
      ErrorEnhancer(), // Custom middleware
    ],
  ),
);
```

### Handle Shutdown Properly

Ensure logs are written before your app exits:

```dart
final logger = await Logger.create(/* config with file drivers */);

try {
  // Your application logic
} finally {
  await logger.shutdown();
}
```
