This documentation is now served using docs.page.

Quick start: https://use.docs.page/getting-started

docs.page uses your repository as source. Place Markdown in docs and configure the homepage in docs/index.mdx (or index.md).

To preview locally, use any static Markdown previewer or serve the repo via a simple static server.
